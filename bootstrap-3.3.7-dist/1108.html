                <p>I can be tough I can be strong But with you It's not like that at all There's a girl That gives a shit Behind this wall You just walked through it [Pre-Chorus:] And I remember all those crazy things you said You left them running through my head You're always there, you're everywhere But right now I wish you were here. All those crazy things we did Didn't think about it, just went with it You're always there, you're everywhere But right now I wish you were here [Chorus:] Damn, Damn, Damn, What I'd do to have you Here, here, here I wish you were here.
