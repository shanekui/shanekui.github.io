            Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
            <ol>
                <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
                <li>Magic City, ID</li>
                <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
                <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
                <li>Truth or Consequences</li>
                <li>NM, Why, AZ</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

            I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
            <blockquote>Passing cars,
                <br>When you can't see,
                <br> May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.
                <br> I definitely won't be passing any cars.</blockquote>

        <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
            <ul>
                <li>Cellphone</li>
                <li>IPod</li>
                <li>Digital camera</li>
                <li>A protein bar</li>
            </ul>
            <br>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
            <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
